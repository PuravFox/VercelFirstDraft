Setting up SSH for GitHub on Windows allows you to securely connect to your GitHub repositories without having to enter your username and password each time. Here’s a step-by-step guide to generate an SSH key, add it to your GitHub account, and configure it for your repositories.

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key

1. **Open Git Bash**:
   - If you don’t have Git Bash installed, download and install it from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

2. **Generate a New SSH Key**:
   - In Git Bash, run the following command (replace `your_email@example.com` with your actual email address associated with your GitHub account):
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
   - When prompted:
     - **Enter a file in which to save the key**: Press **Enter** to accept the default location (`/c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_rsa`).
     - **Enter passphrase (optional)**: You can enter a passphrase for added security or press **Enter** to leave it empty.

3. **Confirm Key Generation**:
   - After you complete the above steps, you should see output similar to this:
     ```
     Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.
     Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
     The key fingerprint is:
     SHA256:examplekey your_email@example.com
     ```

### Step 2: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent

1. **Start the SSH Agent**:
   - In Git Bash, run:
     ```bash
     eval $(ssh-agent -s)
     ```
   - You should see output like `Agent pid 1234`.

2. **Add Your SSH Key**:
   - Add the private key to the SSH agent:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```

### Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

1. **Copy the Public Key**:
   - Run the following command to copy your public key to the clipboard:
     ```bash
     clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can open the public key file with:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```
   - Then manually copy the output.

2. **Add the Key to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub account.
   - Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select **Settings**.
   - In the left sidebar, click on **SSH and GPG keys**.
   - Click the **New SSH key** button.
   - In the **Title** field, enter a name for the key (e.g., "My Laptop").
   - In the **Key** field, paste your public key.
   - Click **Add SSH key**.

### Step 4: Test Your SSH Connection

1. **Test the Connection**:
   - In Git Bash, run the following command:
     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```
   - You should see a message like:
     ```
     Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
     ```

### Step 5: Configure Your Repository to Use SSH

1. **Change the Remote URL to SSH**:
   - Navigate to your local repository directory in Git Bash.
   - Change the remote URL to the SSH version:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo.git
     ```

2. **Verify the Change**:
   - Check that the remote URL has been updated correctly:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - You should see output similar to:
     ```
     origin  git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo.git (fetch)
     origin  git@github.com:YourUsername/YourRepo.git (push)
     ```

### Conclusion

You have successfully set up SSH for your GitHub repository on Windows. Now you can clone, push, and pull from your repositories without entering your username and password every time. If you have any further questions or run into issues, feel free to ask!
